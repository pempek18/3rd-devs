    "description": "The image serves as the cover for an article titled \"Audio i interfejs głosowy,\" highlighting the use of large language models in advanced voice interfaces. Central to the composition is an abstract depiction of a large microphone, around which vibrant green paint splatters spread dynamically against a stark white background. A small silhouetted figure stands gazing at the microphone, creating a sense of scale and emphasizing the theme of human interaction with technology. This visual metaphorically represents the integration of text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, underscoring the transformative potential of voice interfaces in digital communication."

    "description": "The image illustrates a voice-operated conversational interface designed as a 'phone call' format with a large language model. Set against a dark background, the interface shows a chat-like interaction with two speech bubbles—one in blue asking, \"Hey there, what's up? How are you?\" and a gray response stating, \"Hey Adam! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you? What's new with you?\" Below this exchange is a blue \"Hang up\" button. This interface exemplifies a hands-free communication method, aligning with the lesson's focus on voice-controlled technologies."

    "description": "The image displays the dark-themed interface of 'groqcloud,' highlighting the Whisper model, specifically 'whisper-large-v3.' It showcases options for speech input through 'Start Recording' and 'Select File.' The interface supports various audio formats such as flac, mp3, and mp4, with a 25MB file size limit, emphasizing Whisper's capabilities in effective transcription and handling of audio files."

    "description": "The image showcases a digital interface with a black background, part of a system used in the Whisper model for transcription. On the left, specific name spellings—'AI_devs, eduweb, Tech•sistence'—are noted to improve transcription accuracy by introducing relevant vocabulary. The right side features audio options such as 'Start Recording' and 'Select File,' complete with a waveform icon, illustrating the transcription process. Below, the transcript segment reads, \"Hello there, it's Adam from Tech•sistence,\" demonstrating the integration of system prompts in transcription to enhance content relevance, distinct from language model instructions."

    "description": "The image displays an audio interface with features for starting a recording and selecting a file, along with details on file size and supported formats. Below, a segment labeled 'Thank you.' is transcribed, accompanied by an option to copy JSON data. The notable aspect, as highlighted by the context, is the erroneous transcription produced by the Whisper model when processing a 5-second silence. The vivid green background contrasts with the interface, emphasizing the transcription error in silent recordings or very short commands."

    "description": "The image is a diagram illustrating the flow of voice interaction, consisting of three stages: 'Audio Input' in a yellow dashed box, 'Processing' in a red dashed box, and 'Audio Output' in a green dashed box, connected by arrows. The black background accentuates the progression from input to output, highlighting the central 'Processing' stage. This depiction emphasizes the need for integrating additional logic, access to tools, and external knowledge sources to enhance the functionality and comprehensiveness of voice interfaces, as indicated by the contextual information."

    "description": "The image shows a JavaScript code snippet within a code editor, focused on an asynchronous function called `startRecording`. This script is designed to initiate an audio recording by accessing a user's microphone, establishing an audio context, and implementing custom audio processing via an AudioWorklet. The function also features real-time frequency analysis for visualization and uses a try-catch block for error management. Comments within the code highlight its functionality. This visual aligns with the context by illustrating a systematic method for capturing and processing audio inputs, facilitating voice detection, transcription, and interaction through response generation post-silence. The code is presented on a dark background with color-highlighted syntax for clarity."

    "description": "The image displays a transcription interface, illustrating the utility of dedicated solutions like Happyscribe or AssemblyAI for processing longer audio content. On the left, there's a detailed transcript with timestamps and text, while on the right, a video preview showcases a digital assistant app with a purple background. The setup emphasizes the advantages of using comprehensive interfaces and APIs provided by such services for effective transcription management."

    "description": "The image is a flowchart diagram with a green border on a dark background, illustrating a voice interface system's architecture. It depicts the flow of audio and text data through various components, such as the User, User Interface, Backend Server, and systems for Transcription (using OpenAI Whisper or Groq Whisper) and Chat Completion (via OpenAI Chat API). The chart shows processes like transcription, error handling, and text-to-speech conversion with tools like OpenAI TTS and ElevenLabs TTS, connected by purple lines and arrows. This structure emphasizes the complexity of achieving high-quality, real-time voice interaction with large language models (LLMs) by integrating elements like audio quality verification, dynamic silence detection, and contextual transcription."
